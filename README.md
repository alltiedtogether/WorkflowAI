# WorkflowAI
My AI workflow
This is going to be where I maintain the documentation for my development process on integrating different AI models e.g. Perplexity, Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude and Grok to work in such a way that the build and process prompts to generate, review and summarize the responses of each other. Each conversation while be cataloged in to a Notion database and Obsidian vault where further analysis of conversations can easily be refenced for persistence. Once this funtionality can be streamlined then we can move on ro more intergrations. This project is something that Im doing to help others out there as well as further educate myself. I will try to keep all of this open source and free as much as possible. Note that htere are better functionalities out of osme of the paid versions, however we will narrow down what ones we actrually will pay for.
